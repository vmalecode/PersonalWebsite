                            While learning to write 
                            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SOLID</a>
                            code, a number of symptoms have presented themselves that help me realize when refactoring is required: A function call 
                            returning information that is not needed, copying and pasting sections of similar code, or inheritance that doesnâ€™t make sense. While programming chess,
                            it was clear that there were several scanning methods that were required to look across the chess board, and saw this as a good opportunity to share 
                            common methods across chess piece objects.
                            <br>
                            An area where I struggled, however, is in pawn movement; The asymmetric nature of pawn attack and movement is due to the fact that one color moves up the board, and another down. While I could have applied some sort of rotation vector, or control logic to modify a common method that could be applied to both black and white pieces, I opted to write separate methods for black and white pawns. However, if I revisit chess someday, I will use lessons learned to write more generic code.
