# Writeup Questions
Requirement: A writeup responding to the following questions and ideas (at least 3 sentences per bullet point)

### What was the most challenging piece of this assignment?  Did you find it easy or challenging to work with HTML and CSS?  How long did this overall assignment take you?
* I took a while gaining experience with CSS flex and grid. I also took some time to decide how many fonts / colors to incorporate into the website. Too many and the theme looks hectic and confused. I spent 40 hours on this assignment.

### What decisions did you make when you made your site mobile friendly?
* I added a media query to modify the styling for small screens. I reduced margin on all pages, and decreased the font title and navbar size. On the projects tab, I switched from a two-column layout to a single column.

### What did you take into account when you developed the design of your website?  Is there anything that youâ€™re particularly proud of?
* It was important for pertinant information to be easy to access, and for the site layout to be immediately obvious. The colors and fonts were also important to a clean, simple, and professional presentation. Dark-theme is better than light theme, and I believe my website is a good example of a well-implemented dark theme. 

### Given more time or resources, what additional features would you add to your site in the future? 
* I want to create a back end for my website, and utilize an API from Google to demonstrate my ability to do so. I also will use WebGL to imbed some simple Unity games I will make.

### If you used code or design from somewhere online, please mention it here.  Furthermore, if you imported a file to use a Fonts or Icons library, please indicate that here as well.
* I used an icon from www.flaticon.com. I used LinkedIn and Github's logo in the Contact page. All of the website's design and code was done exclusively by myself. 

### How many hours did you spend on this assignment?
* I spent 40 hours on this assignment.
